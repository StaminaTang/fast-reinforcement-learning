# Fast Reinforcement Learning
This repo is not affiliated with Jeremy Howard or his course which can be found here: [here](https://www.fast.ai/about/)
We will be using components from the Fastai library however for building and training our reinforcement learning (RL) 
agents.

My motivation is that existing frameworks commonly use tensorflow, which nothing against tensorflow, but I have 
accomplished more in shorter periods of time using PyTorch. As a note, here is a run down of existing RL frameworks:
- [Intel Coach](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/coach) 
- [Tensor Force](https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce)
- [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines)
- [Tensorflow Agents](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents)
- [KerasRL](https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl)
However there are also frameworks in PyTorch most notably Facebook's Horizon:
- [Horizon](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Horizon)
- [DeepRL](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/DeepRL/blob/master/LICENSE)



## Code 


### 1. Preprocessing

### 2. Modeling

### 3. Dashboard

## TODO


### Git + Workflow


### Style
Fastai does not follow closely with [google python style guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#3164-guidelines-derived-from-guidos-recommendations),
however in this repo we will use this guide.  
Some exceptions however (typically found in Fastai):
- "PEP 8 Multiple statements per line violation" is allowed in the case of if statements as long as they are still 
within the column limit.
